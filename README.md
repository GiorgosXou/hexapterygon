- - [More auto-debloating lists](https://github.com/GiorgosXou/hexapterygon/tree/main/device_repo_lists)


# ‚öôÔ∏è Configure

Before begining the process of debloating, make sure you:

- Backed-up your personal data *(Advised)*
- `pip install hexapterygon --upgrade`
- Have [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) installed 
- Enabled `developer mode` & `USB debugging` *(under settings)*
- Enabled [Security settings](## 'Allow granting permissions and simulating input via USB (if possible)') & [Install via USB](## '[INSTALL] installing won\'t work if it is not enabled') *(optionally, [usually necessary])*
- Disabled services under `setting > ... > Device admin apps` *(optionally)*

# üí• Debloat
To begin the proccess of debloating you either just run `hexapterygon` in your terminal *(while your device is connected and configured)* or `hexapterygon`  and the path-*(file\folder)* or repository to you debloating list(s) like:

```terminal
$ hexapterygon username/my_repository
```
```terminal
$ hexapterygon ./my_debloating_list.txt
```
```terminal
$ hexapterygon ./folder_full_of_lists_named_by_type_identifier_txt
```

# ü´¥ Contribute
### üìú Debloating lists
Your lists is what makes this tool actually powerfull and user-friendly, without your list-contributions this tool can't work standalone. To contribute a list you just need to:

- ***Create a new repository with a folder called `devices` where you:***
- - Create your debloating-list(s) in the form of `{type_identifier}.txt` 
- - - (use: `hexapterygon --getid` to get the `{type_identifier}`)
- - - [(Take this list as an example)](https://github.com/GiorgosXou/Our-Xiaomi-Redmi-5A-riva-debloating-list/blob/main/devices/Xiaomi%20Redmi%205A%20riva.txt)
- ***Make a pull-request or open an issue and:*** 
- - ask to add your repo (see `device_repo_lists`)

And you are done

### üíª To the code
Propose whatever you want, just don't mess up with my weird indentation :P

# üó∫Ô∏è Documentation
The only documentation that you need is the code itself. JK, it is under construction üõ†Ô∏èüèóÔ∏è

# üîç Research
My research can be found under my personal debloating list [here](https://github.com/GiorgosXou/Our-Xiaomi-Redmi-5A-riva-debloating-list/#research) 

# üí≠ Questions

> How do I install [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)?

You either manually download the tools from the link above and install them or use your package manager to install them like for example: `sudo pacman -S android-tools` *(following this [video for windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GI3z6tI3E))*

> How do I make sure [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and `adb` are installed?

Just run `hexapterygon` or the command `adb shell` while the phone is connected *(with `USB debugging` already enabled)*, a pop-up message on you phone should show-up, to allow the computer to connect to it

> Where are `Device admin apps` and what do I disable?

Somewhere under settings, depends on the device. 


> Why do I get a `github.GithubException.RateLimitExceededException` and what can I do?

Most probably because you exceeded the github's limit for requests without a token. To solve this, you can either restart your rooter or provide a classic github-token *(without any special permissions checked)*

> How do i get the {type_identifier}?

Just run the command `hexapterygon --getid` *(while your authorized device is connected)*

# üï≥Ô∏è Outro
This is part 1/3 of a software series project called "beyond self destruction" which rises from within one's self. For those wondering: "Debloating Android Devices" = "Uninstalling\Deleting preinstalled unwanted data-collecting\spyware apps and etc." = "better performance" = "Unleashing the power of self destruction"
